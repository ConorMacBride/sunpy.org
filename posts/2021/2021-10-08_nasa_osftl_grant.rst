SunPy Awarded a NASA Grant
==========================

**As part of the NASA "Open Source Tools, Frameworks, and Libraries" program the SunPy proposal "Strengthening the Foundations of the SunPy Ecosystem" has been funded for the next three years.**

This proposal was submitted in January 2021, it aims to provide funding for both the core `sunpy` package and the larger goals of the project as a whole.
After `some early community input <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-project/issues/9>`__ Albert Shih took on leading writing the proposal, with the funds being awarded through NASA GSFC.
`The proposal <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gf1HM7iIUVqgHAdDUFQfCUHzHkrEFUTJZP8O3PEoqw>`__ focuses on three main areas:

1. Improving the technical infrastructure.

   This section focuses on the tools that the project as a whole needs as we adopt more coordinated and affiliated packages.
   To support multiple active projects with a common development workflow more tooling and infrastructure is needed, both for the maintainers of the packages and developers new to writing affiliated packages.
   As part of this work the package template(s) will be improved, documentation will be written, and new bots and monitoring will be developed to ease the maintenance burden on the SunPy maintainers.

2. Augmenting science-enabling functionality.

   This section aims to improve the tools provided by the core package to better support future challenges in solar physics data.
   The two main components of this are supporting multi-point observations with improvements to the `sunpy.coordinates` package, and improving the support for very large datasets in `sunpy` and sponsored packages by increasing support for `Dask <https://dask.org>`__.

3. Providing training and outreach

   This section will improve the example gallery's of `sunpy` and the affiliated packages, develop training materials for solar physics grad students, and outreach with instrument teams and package developers.


What will the money pay for?
----------------------------

The money awarded to this proposal will pay for development time:

  * Albert Shih will be funded to spend some time in his role as `sunpy.coordinates` maintainer.
  * Stuart Mumford will be funded to work on infrastructure for all sponsored and affiliated packages as discussed in `sunpy/sunpy-project#2 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-project/issues/2>`__.
  * Lastly, it will fund a 70% FTE role based at NASA GSFC focusing on the outreach and large dataset support components of the project.


Finally
-------

On a personal note, this is a major milestone for SunPy, this is a significant amount of funding to be dedicated to directly working for the long term good of the project.
I am hopeful that this funding and the time it will enable us to spend on the project will help to significantly grow SunPy; both the core package and the ecosystem of other packages we want to grow around it.
Also, I am just really excited to be able to call working on SunPy my job for a few years ðŸ¥³.
